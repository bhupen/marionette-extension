This package proves enhancement to the out of the box release of Backbone Marionette. The implementation certainly does not require using Marionette however it does provide automatic extensions to the Marionette framework that saves the user from writing glue code just to integrate the functionality into your app.

The idea for this came out of my project implemented using Backbone Marionette where I had to spend considerable time writing boiler plate code to integrate the application components.

I am a big proponent of code for description so please see the examples on how to use the framework. I will add more examples as I go.

Hope fully this help. Any comments will be greatly appreciated.

ENJOY.
